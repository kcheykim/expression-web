# Expression Web

The Expression Web is a social media with API for social network using NoSQL database. When the Expression Web application starts on the server, the Mongoose models of users and thoughts are synced to the MongoDB database. The web expression (social network) API can GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for users, their thoughts, adding friends to their list, and save reactions to thoughts. This application showcases the use of MongoDB or NoSQL to create a social or expression of network or web.
